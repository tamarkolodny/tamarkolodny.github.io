However, the underlying brain mechanisms are not clear. This study aimed to underpin atypical inhibition-related brain activation and connectivity patterns in ADHD using a novel Go/No-go task design, and to determine its association with clinical symptoms of the disorder. Methods: Forty-eight adults with ADHD performed a Go/No-go task in which target frequency was manipulated during functional MRI. Specific inhibition-related brain activation was correlated with ADHD symptom severity, to assess the relationship of individual differences in engagement of inhibition-related brain circuits with the magnitude of every-day functioning impairments. Finally, generalized psychophysical interaction analyses were carried out to examine whether not only engagement but also functional connectivity between regions implicated in response inhibition is related to symptom severity. Results: We found no evidence for the expected parietal modulation by increased demand for inhibition at the group-level results. However, this lack of modulation was mediated by individual differences in ADHD symptom severity – increased engagement of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in inhibition-demanding events was evident in individuals with less severe symptoms but dissipated with increase in symptomatology. Similarly, functional connectivity between the IPS and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) was elevated under high inhibitory demand conditions, but this effect diminished with increased symptom severity. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of IPS engagement in response inhibition and suggest that IPS modulation may be driven by top-down control from the IFG. Moreover, the current findings force the point of treating ADHD as a continuum whereby brain correlates are scaled with severity of the disorder, and point to the potential use of individual differences in the modulation of IPS activation and connectivity as a neuromarker of ADHD.","tags":null,"title":"Fronto-parietal engagement in response inhibition is inversely scaled with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott O Murray","\u003cb\u003eTamar Kolodny\u003c/b\u003e","Michael-Paul Schallmo","Jennifer Gerdts","Raphael A Bernier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"335c4ef0c3ab9ff5c7262502ef2079fc","permalink":"/publication/late_fmri/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/late_fmri/","section":"publication","summary":"Disrupted cortical neural inhibition has been hypothesized to be a primary contributor to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This hypothesis predicts that ASD will be associated with an increase in neural responses. We tested this prediction by comparing fMRI response magnitudes to simultaneous visual, auditory, and motor stimulation in ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. No increases in the initial transient response in any brain region were observed in ASD, suggesting that there is no increase in overall cortical neural excitability. Most notably, there were widespread fMRI magnitude increases in the ASD response following stimulation offset, approximately 6–8 s after the termination of sensory and motor stimulation. In some regions, the higher fMRI offset response in ASD could be attributed to a lack of an “undershoot”—an often observed feature of fMRI responses believed to reflect inhibitory processing. Offset response magnitude was associated with reaction times (RT) in the NT group and may explain an overall reduced RT in the ASD group. Overall, our results suggest that increases in neural responsiveness are present in ASD but are confined to specific components of the neural response, are particularly strong following stimulation offset, and are linked to differences in RT.\"","tags":null,"title":"Late fMRI response components are altered in autism spectrum disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eTamar Kolodny\u003c/b\u003e","Michael-Paul Schallmo","Jennifer Gerdts","Raphael A Bernier","Scott O Murray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7f7c5f1de6d83acc62f9350a016a5e29","permalink":"/publication/response_dissociation/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/response_dissociation/","section":"publication","summary":"A prominent hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of autism is that an increase in the balance between neural excitation and inhibition results in an increase in neural responses. However, previous reports of population-level response magnitude in individuals with autism have been inconsistent. Critically, network interactions have not been considered in previous neuroimaging studies of excitation and inhibition imbalance in autism. In particular, a defining characteristic of cortical organization is its hierarchical and interactive structure; sensory and cognitive systems are comprised of networks where later stages inherit and build upon the processing of earlier input stages, and also influence and shape earlier stages by top-down modulation. Here we used the well established connections of the human visual system to examine response magnitudes in a higher-order motion processing region [middle temporal area (MT+)] and its primary input region (V1). Simple visual stimuli were presented to adult individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n = 24, mean age 23 years, 8 females) and neurotypical controls (n = 24, mean age 22, 8 females) during fMRI scanning. We discovered a strong dissociation of fMRI response magnitude between region MT+ and V1 in individuals with ASD: individuals with high MT+ responses had attenuated V1 responses. The magnitude of MT+ amplification and of V1 attenuation was associated with autism severity, appeared to result from amplified suppressive feedback from MT+ to V1, and was not present in neurotypical controls. Our results reveal the potential role of altered hierarchical network interactions in the pathophysiology of ASD.","tags":null,"title":"Response dissociation in hierarchical cortical circuits: a unique feature of autism spectrum disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael-Paul Schallmo","\u003cb\u003eTamar Kolodny\u003c/b\u003e","Alexander M Kale","Rachel Millin","Anastasia V Flevaris","Richard AE Edden","Jennifer Gerdts","Raphael A Bernier","Scott O Murray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b28e4df96c40870403fad32ddea9a578","permalink":"/publication/weaker_neural/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weaker_neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Abnormal sensory processing has been observed in autism, including superior visual motion discrimination, but the neural basis for these sensory changes remains unknown.

Critical sex-based neural differences are indicated by, for example, conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that have a strong sex bias with a higher prevalence among males. Motivated by this broader context, we report a marked sex difference in a visual motion perception task among neurotypical adults. Motion duration thresholds — the minimum duration needed to accurately perceive motion direction—were considerably shorter for males than females. We replicated this result across three laboratories and 263 total participants. This type of enhanced performance has previously been observed only in special populations including ASD, depression, and senescence. The observed sex difference cannot be explained by general differences in speed of visual processing, overall visual discrimination abilities, or potential motor-related differences. We also show that while individual differences in motion duration thresholds are associated with differences in fMRI responsiveness of human MT+, surprisingly, MT+ response magnitudes did not differ between males and females. Thus, we reason that sex differences in motion perception are not captured by an MT+ fMRI measure that predicts within-sex individual differences in perception. Overall, these results show how sex differences can manifest unexpectedly, highlighting the importance of sex as a factor in the design and analysis of perceptual and cognitive studies.","tags":null,"title":"Sex differences in visual motion processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eTamar Kolodny\u003c/b\u003e","Yael Ashkenazi","Moran Farhi","Lilach Shalev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"9851e96dd564a69337d8aba525fc4b03","permalink":"/publication/computerized_progressive/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/computerized_progressive/","section":"publication","summary":"Higher education students with ADHD cope with various academic obstacles such as difficulty to sustain attention while studying and deficient ability to focus attention effectively on academic tasks. Shalev et al. (Child Neuropsychology, 13(4), 382–388, 2007) have developed a computerized progressive attentional training (CPAT) program for children with ADHD, which is composed of four sets of structured tasks designed to uniquely activate various attentional functions: sustained-, selective-spatial, orienting-, and executive-attention. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the CPAT vs. an active control training program on improving attention functioning among high functioning adults with ADHD. Thirty participants, randomly assigned either to the CPAT or to the active control (computer games; CG) groups, completed 16 1-h training sessions across 8 weeks. Attention functioning was assessed using both objective and subjective tools three times: before the intervention (pre-test), after the intervention (post-test), and at follow-up (2–3 months later). Participants in the CPAT group exhibited significantly greater improvements in selective-spatial attention and in executive attention tasks (that were different than the attention training tasks) compared to participants in the CG group, and these gains were maintained at follow-up. These results provide strong evidence for near transfer effects of the CPAT. In addition, modest improvement in sustained attention was recorded in both training groups. However, analyses of the self-reported ADHD symptoms across the three points of assessment showed no change in either group. Future studies with larger samples should replicate and elaborate the present findings in order to assess whether the near transfer effects of the CPAT program could be translated to everyday functioning in high functioning adults with ADHD.","tags":null,"title":"Computerized progressive attention training (CPAT) vs. active control in adults with ADHD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eTamar Kolodny\u003c/b\u003e","Carmel Mevorach","Lilach Shalev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6bcf8e11ba949c1645dbc085f19c578b","permalink":"/publication/isolating_response/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/isolating_response/","section":"publication","summary":"Response inhibition is a main function of cognitive control and its neural substrates have been studied extensively.

Although inhibition is required in all No-go trials, task variants with rare-No-go cases (25%) create a prepotent response which elicits a strong demand for inhibition, while task variants with prevalent-No-go cases (75%) require very little inhibition effort. Since the neural activation in this design is extracted solely from No-go trials, differing only in the extent of inhibitory demand, the analysis avoids contamination of the data with motor effects or visual factors. Using this experimental design we highlight the contribution of the parietal cortex (bilaterally) to inhibitory processes, while casting doubts about the specificity of frontal activation in such processes.

To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the various difficulties of individuals with ADHD, especially when co-occurrence difficulties are present, it is essential to combine neuropsychological and subjective assessment tools. In the present field study the authors investigated a group of adolescents with multiple deficits (MD) using neuropsychological and subjective measures. Teachers’ ratings verified extremely high levels of symptoms of oppositional behavior, inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, social problems, and emotional problems in this group. As expected, MD group participants showed decreased abilities to maintain attention on task for a long period of time, focus attention and effectively inhibit adjacent distractors, and resist conflicting irrelevant information. Importantly, although significant differences in the attention measures were observed at the group level, not all MD participants displayed deviant performance. Thus, we conclude that the heterogeneous group of adolescents with MD comprises individuals with primary attention deficits as well as those with other nonattentional deficits that show equivalent behavioral symptoms. Using neuropsychological tools can be useful in differentiating between different core deficits and in guiding appropriate interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Attention functioning among adolescents with multiple learning, attentional, behavioral, and emotional difficulties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" במעבדה של ד״ר רועי שוורץ בביה״ס להנדסה ולמדעי המחשב באוניברסיטה העברית מתבצע מחקר בעיבוד שפה טבעית (Natural Language Processing). מטרת המחקר שלנו להנגיש את טכנולוגית עיבוד השפה למגוון אוכלוסיות - רופאים, מורים, חוקרים, ואפילו נערים סקרנים. על מנת להשיג מטרה זו, על הטכנולוגיה הזו להיות לא רק מדויקת, אלא גם אמינה; המערכות צריכות לספק הסברים להחלטות שלהן, ושיטות ההערכה שלהן צריכות להיות משכנעות. המעבדה גם חוקרת שיטות לייעול הטכנולוגיה של עיבוד טקסט, ולהפיכתה לירוקה, על מנת למזער את ההשפעה הסביבתית של התחום, וגם להוזיל את העלויות של המחקר בבינה מלאכותית כדי להרחיב את מעגלי ההשתתפות בו. ביוגרפיה - רועי שוורץ רועי שוורץ הוא מרצה בכיר בביה״ס להנדסה ולמדעי המחשב באוניברסיטה העברית. לפני כן רועי היה פוסטדוק (2016-2019) ואח״כ עמית מחקר (2019-2020) במכון אלן לבינה מלאכותית ובביה״ס להנדסה ומדעי המחשב באוניברסיטת וושינגטון בסיאטל, שם הוא עבד עם פרופ׳ נוח סמית׳. רועי השלים את לימודי הדוקטורט שלו בשנת 2016 בביה״ס למדעי המחשב באוניברסיטה העברית תחת הנחייתו של פרופ׳ ארי רפופורט. בשנת 2011 הוא סיים את לימודי המאסטר שלו בהצטיינות במדעי המחשב, תחת הנחייתו של פרופ׳ ארי רפופורט. לפני כן, הוא סיים את לימודי הבוגר בהצטיינות במדעי המחשב ומדעי הקוגניציה באוניברסיטה העברית. הוא היה חבר בתוכנית אמירים לתלמידים מצטיינים. ב-2004-2005 הוא עבד כמהנדס תוכנה בחברת צ׳ק פוינט בע״מ. מן העיתונות עיתון הארץ ראיון ב-Ynet כתבת פרופיל באתר ביה״ס למדעי המחשב ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d68fe639af49c099f90764d841b95c4a","permalink":"/hebrew/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hebrew/","section":"","summary":"במעבדה של ד״ר רועי שוורץ בביה״ס להנדסה ולמדעי המחשב באוניברסיטה העברית מתבצע מחקר בעיבוד שפה טבעית (Natural Language Processing). מטרת המחקר שלנו להנגיש את טכנולוגית עיבוד השפה למגוון אוכלוסיות - רופאים, מורים, חוקרים, ואפילו נערים סקרנים.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d686074f00ba84d4757f75524bbc0c89","permalink":"/project/green_nlp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/green_nlp/","section":"project","summary":"The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months.
